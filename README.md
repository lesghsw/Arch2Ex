# Welcome!
This is the repo where i upload all the ADE exercises i do.

This Franco Liberati's website (Where i got the exercises from): https://arch2.scienceontheweb.net/esercizi.html.

## To find an exercise just navigate to the correct folder:

The first folder's number correspond to that exercise collection's number (folder 12 corresponds to "**Esercizi 12 MIPS: Matrici**").

The second folder corresponds to the exact exercise (folder 1 corresponds to "**Traccia 1**").

# Feel free to open issues, i will gladly update the repo and respond to answers.
You can contact me on instagram or telegram @lesghsw for a most rapid answer.
